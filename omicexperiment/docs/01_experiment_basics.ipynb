    "# The Experiment object\n",
    "The OmicExperiment object is the heart of the omicexperiment package.\n",
    "It has the ultimate goal of providing a pleasant API for rapid analysis of 'omic experiments' in an interactive environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R bioinformatics community has already provided similar implementations for similar functionality.\n",
    "Examples include DESeqDataSet (from the package DeSeq2), MRExperiment (from the package metagenomeSeq), phyloseq-class (from the package phyloseq).\n",
    "To my knowledge, there exists no similar powerful functionality available to users of python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Powerful manipulation of large datasets in comparative omic experiment (and these are numerous, and include amplicon microbiome studies, microbial metagenomics, transcriptomics/RNA-Seq, metabolomics, and proteomics, and microarray). According to the Biological Observation Matrix (BIOM) format: \"they all share an underlying, core data type: the “sample by observation contingency table”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OmicExperiment object (perhaps intended to be subclassed for each specific use-case of the above) is the centrepiece of this functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The philosophy of this package is to build upon solid foundations of the python scientific stack and try not to re-invent the wheel. Packages such as numpy and pandas are powerful optimized libraries in dealing with matrix and tabular data, respectively. This package's main dependency is pandas objects (as well as the rest of the scientific python stack).\n",
    "\n",
    "As of this date, I have started mainly with implementing functionality in the MicrbiomeExperiment subclass of the parent OmicExperiment class, as this is what I have been recently working on in my research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clever scientific interactive computing environments are an excellent way to apply and demonstrate the analysis of scientific datasets. The Jupyter notebook is perhaps the prime example of such an environment, perfectly suited for rapid iteration and exploratory analysis, as well as documentation and literate programming."
